# pima_prediction 
A Scikit-Learn machine learning model for Pima Indians to predict the probability of developing diabetes. 

The data is from a course on Degreed by Jerry Kurata. I used the data files and Jerry's course to immerse myself in the machine learning workflow. The Jupyter-Notebook walks through the processing of data and the training/evaluation of multiple models. I made edits to the commentary and code to help with my own understanding.
